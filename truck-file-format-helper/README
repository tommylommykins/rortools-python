This is a tool to generate maxscript and python code for parsing truck files,
applying the values read from those truck files to 3dsmax custattributes,
and writing them back out to truck files

This eliminates a problem where information about the truck file
would have to be duplicated in the parser, importer, custattributes code, and exporter.

Instead the necessary information is recorded in a spreadsheet, and the appropriate
python and maxscript code will be generated

== parser ==
The parser needs to know the following information about each data item of any particular
data-line:
* name and position on the line
* data type
* optional
* separator from previous item

== importer ==
The importer needs to know...? 
* which fields are necessary for sameness-comparison

== custattributes ==
Custattributes are responsible for saving the data when outside of either the importer
or the exporter, as well as allowing the data to be edited. It needs to know:
* name
* data type
* optional
* default value
* range
* ui control 

== exporter ==
The exporter needs to know:
* name and position on the line
* separator from previous item
